# Research jupyter templates
Saving my jupyter templates here.

This package is simply using the [jupyterlab_templates](https://github.com/timkpaine/jupyterlab_templates) and copying the template notebooks from this repo into the templates folder: "\Lib\site-packages\jupyterlab_templates\templates\jupyterlab_templates"

Documenting what my notebooks do is something that I'm usually pretty lazy about. I will here be experimenting with jupyter notebook templates, 
with a good structure that enforces good documentation and that can be used over and over again.
